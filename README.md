This one-page site is my final work of the Front-End Basic course in Dnipro IT Hillel School.

The initial layout was provided by 3 photoshop files with 3 options of viewport width: tablets, desktop, large desktop.
In accordance with the layout, the minimum size of viewport is near 740px.

This site has an adaptive design. I was used Bootstrap grid system for doing this.
Breakpoints was fixed at 750px, 1300px, 1500px.

The possibilities of SASS were used for writing styles on this project.

All styles are written with methodology of BEM.

In addition to HTML and CSS some modules with javascript were also used: ScrollSpy JS, Bootstrap slider.
